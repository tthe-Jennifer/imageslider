Json file for image storage in an object

indicator linked to respective image number, actionable to go to respective image
#summary This carousel allows the user to click the backwards or forwards button to go to the previous or next image.

The images are stored in a simple array. I used use state in order to store the current image. Then updated that state to go to the previous or next image, according to the button the user pressed.

When the user has gone through all of the images, It starts again at the beginning of the array, to allow them to cycle through the images again.
